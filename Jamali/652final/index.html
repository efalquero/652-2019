       <p class="story">In 2009, a filmmaker-turned-attorney felt a yearning for creative expression. </p> 
       <p class="story">Brian Frankel had moved to the Washington metropolitan area two years earlier and missed the tight-knit community of filmmakers he had left behind in Florida. Searching for a similar network of like-minded film enthusiasts, Frankel came across DC Filmmakers, a group founded that same year on the website Meetup.com. However, it was relatively inactive and only hosted a few events in Frankel’s first three years as a member.</p>
       <p class="story"> In 2012, he learned the group organizer had stepped down and DC Filmmakers was set to close unless someone would step up as the new organizer and pay the club dues for its <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DC-Filmmakers/">Meetup site.</a> Subsequently, Frankel decided to take over as the organizer and event creator.  “As a creative person, I just really enjoyed having other creative people who I could learn from and who I could work with,” he says. “If I didn't find what I needed, I was like, ‘Well, I'm going to build it.’”</p> 
       <p class="story"> From this point on, Frankel has led DC Filmmakers, organizing multiple events annually to foster a community devoted to healthy creative expression in the form of filmmaking. Two recurring events have become local mainstays of community entertainment.</p>

   <h2>Creation of the Wheaton Film Festival</h2>
   <div id="festival">
     <image class="wff image-desktop" src ="./Media/wff.png"/>

     <p class="story">Since Frankel took the helm, DC Filmmakers has become best known for the annual Wheaton Film Festival that began in 2014. The organization was first approached about the project in 2014 by the Montgomery County Arts and Humanities Council. The agency was impressed with DC Filmmakers’ previous work organizing cueFILM, an online and televised film festival created in collaboration with Cox Communications.</p>  
     <p class="story">Wheaton, along with Bethesda and Silver Spring, is one of the three Arts and Entertainment Districts in Montgomery County. <a href="https://www.mymcmedia.org/arts-and-humanities-council-offers-cultural-grants-in-wheaton/">It has been historically underserved in its arts programming,</a> Arts and Humanities Council CEO Suzan Jenkins told Montgomery Community Media. The Wheaton Film Festival has improved the arts and humanities presence in Wheaton and Montgomery County.</p> <p class="story"> The fifth annual Wheaton Film Festival will take place on Friday, November 8, 2019. In the months leading up to the event, individuals in the Washington metropolitan area have been encouraged to submit short films to be screened, judged, and made eligible for prizes provided by sponsors, including Adobe, Red Giant, and more. The event will also include panel discussions on the future of filmmaking and basics of entertainment law as well as opportunities to network and view various pieces of film equipment.</p>

    <h2>Sparking community storytelling</h2>
    <div id="community">
       <video class="text-wrap vid-desktop" src="./Media/MMM.mp4" preload=auto controls></video> 
       <p class="story">In addition to the Wheaton Film Festival, DC Filmmakers organizes the Make a Movie in a Month competition. Hosted in spring and summer since 2016, participant are tasked with joining teams and fully producing short films in the span of 30 days. As DC Filmmakers member Berlin Waechter describes it, having this sense of accountability “puts a lot of people over the edge they need to go over to make things happen.”</p> 
      <p class="story">For Make a Movie in a Month’s Spring 2019 competition, Waechter directed “In Harmony with the Community,” a short documentary about Capital Accord Chorus, an all-female barbershop choir that performs throughout Montgomery County. Despite a small three-person crew and short production timeframe, Waechter won first place for his film, which included automatic entry into the Wheaton Film Festival.</p> 
      <p class="story">Waechter values his experience with Make a Movie in a Month not only for the opportunity to create a film, but also for the connections he has made. “A lot of people...they may have the desire to make a film, but they don’t have a way, necessarily, to easily find people to help them make that film,” he says. “That’s the reason that Make a Movie in a Month exists. It’s so that they can bring people together.”</p>

    <h2>Advice for newcomers and future plans</h2>
    <div id="future">
        <video class="text-wrap vid-desktop" src="./Media/AdviceforNewcomers.mp4" preload=auto controls></video> 
        <p class="story"> DC Filmmakers seems to have accomplished its mission of bringing people together to work creatively. Its number of members on Meetup.com has grown from 40 to over 2,200 members within a decade. As this number grows, Frankel must always wonder how to appeal to new members who have never before touched a camera. His advice for new filmmakers is to first focus on the filmmaking process, then focus on the people. “If you just have the people on their own, that's not helpful enough,” he says. “If you find an amazing person, if you're not able to talk to them at the level that makes it interesting for them to collaborate with you, then you might have lost that opportunity.”</p>
       <p class="story">Alternately, Waechter suggests that if there is nothing at risk regarding a project, new filmmakers should continue to film projects regardless of their lack of experience. “Books can help a lot. That’s why I went to film school,” he says. “But learning on the fly is indispensable. Trial and error is something that can’t be learned in a book and you just have to do it.”</p> 
       <p class="story">In regards to the future, Frankel maintains that DC Filmmakers will always be a community devoted to facilitating healthy creative expression.</p>
