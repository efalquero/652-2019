        <h3>Twenty-five years after founding, this "living&ndash;learning community" lays claim to helping boost university enrollment, increasing quality of student applicants &mdash; and impacting higher education nationally</h3>

      <div class="intro">
        <p class="lede">Twenty-five years hardly seems like a milestone in the grand scheme of American higher education, where the earliest institutions formed in the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Yet those familiar with the University of Maryland's College Park Scholars program say that, in its quarter-century of existence, the two-year living&ndash;learning program has proven transformative &mdash; for students, the university and even higher education nationwide.</p>
        <p>The idea for the Scholars program came about for entirely practical reasons, however.</p>

          PREVIOUS IMAGE: The opening of College Park Scholars was attended by campus and local VIPs, including Nancy Shapiro (l–r), the first executive director; Dan Fallon, then-provost; an unidentified local politician; William "Brit" Kirwan, then–UMD president; an unidentified student; and Robert Hampton, then–dean of Undergraduate Studies. <span class="source">source: college park scholars archives</span> </section>

        <h2>'Beyond Honors' to boost enrollment</h2>
        <p>"Back in those days, we had many, many exceptional graduate programs. But we weren't known as a really attractive place for bright undergraduates," said William E. "Brit" Kirwan, chancellor emeritus of the University System of Maryland. Kirwan was president of the university when Scholars came to life and spoke at a recent dinner celebrating the program's 25th anniversary.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as recently as the 1970s, UMD followed virtually an open-admissions policy, according to a 2004 article published by Washingtonian. College Park was the kind of place that "you could get into if you had a pulse," History Professor Ira Berlin told the magazine.</p>
        <p>The university's honors program apparently did little to blunt that reputational damage. By the early 1990s, UMD was suffering from such low enrollment that some campus residence halls sat empty.</p>
        <p>Kirwan recruited Berlin, the history professor, as director of undergraduate studies. His charge: to find a way "beyond Honors" to attract more high-achieving students to the university.</p>

        <h2>Small liberal arts college within a public university</h2>
        <p>The answer came in the form of a "living&ndash;learning community," a model that Nancy Shapiro, the founding executive director of Scholars, said "was very new in the mid-1990s." </p>
        <p>The new approach created communities of students who lived together in the residence halls and took a specific set of classes together. Beyond that framework, Berlin and Shapiro decided Scholars would emphasize interdisciplinary learning, incorporate hands-on activities and feature faculty mentorship opportunities.</p>

        <p>They surmised such intentional, engaged academic communities would enhance the student experience in a way that differed from the honors program, which featured small seminar classes limited to faculty members' areas of expertise.</p>

        <br />
        <p>"The vision was to create the experience of a small liberal arts college on a large university campus," said Shapiro, who is now associate vice chancellor for education and outreach for the University System of Maryland.</p>

        <h2>A grand bargain for residence halls</h2>
        <p>Selling others on this revolutionary vision took some doing.</p> 
        <p>Take the student affairs unit, which oversaw the residence halls on campus. Berlin and Shapiro wanted to make use of the empty Cumberland Residence Hall, but launching Scholars there was not merely a matter of having students move in. Berlin was asking to renovate the building, install new furniture <em>and</em> voluntarily relinquish space for non&ndash;income-generating faculty offices and classrooms.</p> 
        <p>"It was sort of a grand bargain," Shapiro said. "Ira said, 'I guarantee we can fill the residence halls, if you can give up some of the space and renovate it.'"</p>

        <h2>Results spur copycat models</h2>
        <p>The first class of Scholars matriculated into UMD in fall 1994, with about 450 students tracked into four interdisciplinary programs. Since then, Scholars has expanded to 12 programs. It now welcomes an estimated quarter of UMD's incoming freshmen each year.<p>
       <p>Alums like Caterina Marzella, who participated in the International Studies Scholars program and graduated from UMD in 2014, say that Scholars provided a perspective she didn't get elsewhere as an undergrad. "I learned to take a multi-disciplinary approach to my work," she said. "In college, it feels a lot like you're put into a box and set on a track when you select your major. In Scholars, I was with a diverse set of people who came from a lot of different majors but shared the same passions as I did."</p>

      <p>Other students have praised the sense of community fostered by their experience: In an annual survey of sophomores completing the program, an average of 62 percent (between 2012 and 2018) cited "community" as the factor they liked most about Scholars.</p>

        <p>Shapiro contends Scholars' impact is even greater than the individual student experience, however. "Scholars transformed undergraduate education in the state," she asserted. "At the University of Maryland, if you look historically at enrollments and the quality of students who applied, College Park Scholars was the turning point."</p>
        <p>Indeed, undergraduate admissions data shows that 14,291 students applied to UMD in 1993 &mdash; the applicants who would have made up the first class of Scholars. Sixty-five percent were admitted, and just more than 36 percent of those students enrolled. By 1998, close to 17,000 students were applying to the university. Only 45 percent of those applicants were being accepted, but just more than 53 percent of those students were enrolling at the university.<p>

      <p>The living&ndash;learning community model has since been adopted by many institutions of higher learning. One of UMD's counterparts in the Big 10, Ohio State University, even calls its program Ohio State <em>Scholars</em>. This is no surprise, given that Kirwan later served as OSU's president.</p>
      <p>"What you have to appreciate is, to the best of our knowledge, there was nothing like it anywhere in the country [at that time]," Kirwan said about College Park Scholars. "The amazing thing is now, you can hardly go to a university anymore where they don't have a program modeled on what we have." <span style="color:#787a39">&#9724;</span>
