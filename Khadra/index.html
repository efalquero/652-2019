        <h3>Initiative 71</h3>
        <p>Initiative 71 was “approved by 64.87% of voters on November 4, 2014 and fully enacted by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser February 26, 2015 . It states that individuals 21 years of age or older may “lawfully possess two ounces or less of marijuana …use it on private property…transfer one ounce or less of it to another person … as long as  no money, goods or services are exchanged; and the recipient is at least 21 years of age.” If you are a D.C. resident, you can also “cultivate up to six marijuana plants within [your] primary residence, no more than three of which are mature.”</p>

        <h3>GrayZone</h3></br></br>
        <p>Billy E is referring to the “gray market” practice of receiving payments in exchange for providing novelty merchandise such as t-shirts and ball caps whose real value is in the “free gifts” they include. The gifts often take the form of marijuana strains, cannabis edibles, THC vape cartridge, and other items whose sale is strictly prohibited by law. </br>Such exchanges often take place within unassuming residences and may sound a lot like the audio clip provided below.</br></br><h2>WARNING:</br>POTENTIALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT</h2>Listen Below</br></br></p>

        <h3>Xtraction</h3>
        <p>He has learned to salvage his “shake- the scattered bits of marijuana plant that are left in the container after all the fat nugs are broken away for gifting". Billy explains that he also barters for others' shake to processes and harvest the plant’s chemical extracts. In additon to the THC ‘wax’ that’s extracted, Billy E. is equally interested in the plant’s cannabidiol- or CBD- which makes up nearly 40% of the plants extracts. It is an increasingly popular derivative of the marijuana plant because of health benefits associated with its ingestion or topical application. It doesn’t produce the psychoactive affects that result from using THC and is not a controlled substance.</p>

        <p>Billy E. has done relatively well living in D.C., but it hasn’t been easy. He maintains an apartment, drives a newer car and makes rent on his apartment “on time, every time” in a city with an especially high cost of living. He is making it paycheck to paycheck, which in Billy E’s world actually means “stacks to stacks” or bartering “bags for bikes”, like the specialized bike he uses to make nearby deliveries.</p>

        <h3>Mixed Clientele</h3>
        <p>From Southeast to Northwest DC, through the gentrifying neighborhoods flanking Rhode Island Ave from Brentwood to Logan Circle, Washingtonians are meeting in the gray to exchnage green for green. According to Billy, “It’s not just ni$$as that be in there. They are in there- their kids are in there...I mean I used to always be in the shows with them right in there paying me. Now, some have me locked in. They call- I stop through.” Billy is referring to his white clients, a customer segment that continues to grow as the demographics of the city changes. The gentrification sweeping across large swaths of District neighborhoods seems a boon to Billy and other like him who are struggling to make a living in the rapidly changing city they've lived all of their lives.</p>

        <h3>Dreams Deferred</h3>
        <p>It’s natural for a businessman to see his source of revenue as a blessing, but Billy E. fails to see the uneven cost-benefit relationship between him and his wealthier, often white clientele. He has moved three times in the last two years because of burglaries, which he maintains were done by locals who are aware of his occupation and "expect to find drugs, stacks of cash or something valubale" inside. Cops broke up a couple of recent shows and Billy E caught himself scrambling out back doors and hoping over fences, worried he might get held up in the alley — or worse — "have to ditch his merchandise, money or phone on the way out".</p>

Only 11% were white, even though whites make up more than 60% of the U.S. population.” 73% is a huge delta when we are talking about the difference between freedom & imprisonment, especially when that deviation occurs along racial lines.</br>Take a look at how it breaks out in DC and 4 nearby states in the interactive chart below.</p>

        <h3>$Illegal Laws$</h3>
        <p>The systemic sabotage of an individual’s ability to thrive in a competitive economy is often masked under the guise of law, exposed only when the unfair application of law is brought out. In her Article, Legalizing Marijuana: Lessons from the Post-prohibition Era, Livia Gershon explains, “opponents of Prohibition argued that repealing the law would boost the economy, produce more tax revenue, and reduce the criminal activity surrounding the underground economy. As the Great Depression took hold, they also warned that uneven enforcement of the law (against the working class but not the wealthy) would stoke resentments.”  Billy E's response to Gershon's insight was surprising: “F@!K resentment- it’s just a feeling”, he fumed. “It’s about what you going to do. You going to either just sit there and resent or you going to do something. That’s what I’m doing. It’s what a lot of people around here trying to do.” </p>

        <h3>Going 4 Gold</h3>
        <p>One could say that Philip Goldberg, a Montgomery County, Maryland native who has run several successful small businesses, is another one of those guys just “trying to make do”. His is currently the CEO of gLeaF Medical Cannabis, and current business projections suggest that weed will be his greatest venture yet. “gLeaf”, also known as Green Leaf Medical, was “one of only 15 companies awarded a license to grow pharmaceutical-grade cannabis in the state of Maryland”, as reported by ABC7’s Caroline Patrickis in February 2018.</div>

        <h3>Ill-egal Law$</h3>
        <p>Post-prohibition, “some state governments chose to hold a monopoly on sales of liquor ‘by the package,’ avoiding profit-motivated expansion of alcohol sales…while others relied on licensing.” Today, that monopolization seems to belong to medicinal cannabis companies. The Baltimore Sun recently highlighted “state regulators concerns that national cannabis corporations are trying to dominate Maryland’s medical marijuana market by skirting rules designed to prevent a few firms from controlling the burgeoning industry”.  What appears to threaten the state’s weed market on the one hand could mean a hugely profitable acquisition for Goldberg on the other. </p>
